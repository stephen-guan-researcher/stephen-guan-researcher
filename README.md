- 🔭 I’m currently working on deploying AI large models at Tencent. My work involves extensive research in various NLP-related tasks, including named entity recognition, prompt tuning, model optimization, embedding encrypted information in generative models, and building retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. These areas are at the forefront of my research efforts, driving innovation and enhancing the capabilities of our AI systems. Additionally, I use cutting-edge algorithms for database security detection and integrate large models to upgrade traditional security technologies.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced NLP algorithms and their application in real-world scenarios.
  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on conference papers (B and C categories) in Artificial Intelligence and Multimedia, as well as journal articles. Areas of interest include named entity recognition, prompt tuning, model optimization, and generative model encryption and information embedding.
  
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with innovative solutions for model tunning.
  
- 💬 Ask me about my work on implementing AI large models and my research experience at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
